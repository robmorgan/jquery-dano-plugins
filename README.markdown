what is this?
=============

this repository contains a small number of jQuery plugins
for use with Dan's CSS & Markup.

Better doco coming soon.

For now include both scripts, then use either:

    $('.checkbox').danoCheckbox();
    
to convert all checkboxes with the class 'checkbox' into Dan's fancy design or:

    $('.dropdown').danoDropdown();
    
to convert all 'select' tags into Dan's fancy combo box design.
